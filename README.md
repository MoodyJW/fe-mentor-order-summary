### What I learned

I learned I hate installing Sass, I might be a little bit color blind, and that I probably should have updated from bash to zsh like two years ago instead of waiting until the middle of working on this

### Useful resources

- [Box shadow generator for fucking cheaters!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator) - this is helpful for the box shadows if you're struggling. I didn't find it until after I was done. ðŸ™ƒ
